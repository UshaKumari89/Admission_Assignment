                <h3>Motivation: Future Good Developer</h3>
              <p>
                Learning new skills is part of a software developer’s role due to the frequent changes and advancements in technology and frameworks. Its  extremely dynamic part of the software industry. Every year there are major new libraries, automation tools, build systems, css frameworks and preprocessors, and even languages that compile down to JavaScript.  I will be able to keep up with what is new, and will learn whatever suits on my skills and requirements.
              </p>
              <p>To became a good developer I have to learn excellent technical skills and write clean, neat code. My code will be frequently well commented and can be easily understood by other team members which will allow them to easily debugged. I will be serious about my work and look to integrate with existing team to produce an excellent result.</p>
              <p>
                As a web developer, my goal is to communicate the message that the client intends. I will be able to understand and implement both user and client perspectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being a good developer i will try “working smarter, not harder.” Instead of just dumping my time and energy into a task, I will take the time to thoughtfully make a plan up front. I will try to take some help from framework and tools to make the task very efficient in shorter time.

             in the market, I am confident that I will make a place for me, because I am quite hard working person and since my childhood I have had a goal to best in whatever I do.
